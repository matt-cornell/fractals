In both the Mandelbrot and Julia fractals, the previous term is squared to get the next term. This can be generalized by raising the previous term to some constant k, with our conventional fractals having k = 2. This generalization of the Mandelbrot set is sometimes called a "multibrot," but I'm unaware of any special name for the extension of Julia fractals.

We can see that for an exponent k, the Mandelbrot now shows rotational symmetry as well, of order k - 1. We'll let u = e^{2πi/(k - 1)}, a complex number that rotates a point by 1/(k - 1) of the circle. With an initial recurrence relation of z_{n + 1} = z_n^k + c, our transformed form will have the form z'_{n + 1} = z'_n^k + uc. If z'_n = uz_n, then z'_{n + 1} = u^{k}z'_n^k + uc. u^k = u, because raising it to k rotates by 1/(k - 1) of the circle k times—it loops all the way around plus one more rotation. From this, we can inductively prove that every element of the series can be rotated by u.

Our Julia fractals also show a higher order of rotational symmetry, of order k. The rotation u = e^{2πi/k} after the first term because u^k = e^2πi = 1. After that, each term of the transformed series is identical to the original.
